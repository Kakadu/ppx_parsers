[ ] Write PPX extension that do something interesting with OCaml parser combinators.
  [ ] Probably we need PPX extension to embed OCaml AST near expression.
[ ] Compare OCaml's naive combinator speed with Scala ones and generated by FastParsers.
[ ] Understand the code which is generated by FastParsers

[Accelerating Parser Combinators with Macros](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/200905/files/p7-beguet.pdf) by Eric BÃ©guet (FastParsers author).

Original idea from https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects .

### Bigarray parser generator

[FastParsers](https://github.com/begeric/FastParsers) is a Scala parser library which uses macros to transform easy-to-write parser combinators into efficient recursive-descent backtracking parsers. The generated parsers are about 20x faster than Scala's parser combinator library even though its interface stay about the same.

An OCaml equivalent that uses Cstruct under the hood to do zero-copy parsing would permit a big speed boost in Mirage's protocol stacks.
